# MyCalculator

In this code, the HTML structure defines a simple calculator layout with two input fields for numbers, four buttons for different operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and a result section to display the calculated result.

The CSS styles are used to format and position the elements within the calculator.

JavaScript functions are included to perform the corresponding calculations based on the button clicked. The calculated result is then displayed in the designated result section.
